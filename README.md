Image Classification of 5 Sports Persons


This project focuses on image classification of five prominent sports personalities: MS Dhoni (cricketer), Roger Federer (tennis player), Serena Williams (tennis player), Maria Sharapova (tennis player), and Lionel Messi (footballer). The goal is to accurately identify and classify images of these individuals using machine learning techniques.

Technologies Used

1. Jupyter Lab: Used for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
2. Flask: Deployed the machine learning model as a web service.
3. HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Developed the front-end web interface for users to interact with the classification system.
4. OpenCV: Utilized for image processing tasks such as reading images and applying Haar Cascade classifiers for facial detection.
5. Haar Cascade: Employed for detecting faces in images as part of the preprocessing pipeline.
6. Pandas DataFrame: Used for handling and manipulating structured data during data preprocessing and analysis.
7. Joblib: Used for saving and loading trained machine learning models.
8. Base64 Encoding: Implemented for converting image data to a format suitable for web transfer and display.
   
Usage

Upload an Image: Navigate to the home page and upload an image of one of the five sports persons.
Classify Image: Click the "Classify" button to see the predicted classification of the uploaded image.

Model Training and Evaluation

1. Data Preprocessing: Includes image resizing, normalization, and Haar Cascade-based facial detection.
2. Model Architecture: Implemented using Jupyter lab.
3. Training and Evaluation: Training was performed on a labeled dataset of images, and model performance was evaluated on a separate test set.


Future Improvements
Enhance model accuracy through fine-tuning and augmentation techniques.
Expand the classification system to include additional sports personalities or refine existing classifications.
Improve the user interface for a more intuitive experience.
